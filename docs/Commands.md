# About 
Vinny has many commands that can be run on either a server or in DMs. 

# How-to
Commands are run by typing a message in a channel that Vinny can see and post in. These messages comprise of two parts, the prefix (Default: `~` and `@Vinny`) and the command (For example `play`). You can set custom prefixes for any server.  
Some commands take in arguments. These arguments effect what the command does. For example the `~play` command can take in either a link to audio, a search. (Example `~play rickroll` or `~play <link to audio>`)  
Commands can also have `aliases`, which are just other names for the command you can use to invoke it. You can also schedule commands to run at
an interval. Using the scheduling feature, you can get all your Vinny automatically.

# Categories
Commands are organized by different categories. Most categories can be given a required minimum role needed to use them.

## Permissions
The way that Vinny does permissions on who can use what commands is by role hierarchy. You can see your servers role hierarchy in the roles settings screen. The higher the role on the list, the higher it is on the hierarchy. The role set as the minimum for a command category is just that, the minimum role a user needs to run that command. If they have a role higher on the list than the current minimum, they can also run the command.
