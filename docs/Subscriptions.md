# Subscriptions
Vinny allows you to setup subscriptions to various other sites on the internet. If something you want to subscribe to is not supported, please let me know on the support server and the devs can see if they can add it.

## Supported subscriptions
* Bluesky - Subscribe to a bluesky user and new posts will be posted
* Reddit - Subscribe to subreddits, all new posts will be posted to discord
* 4chan - Subscribe to 4chan boards (Individual threads coming soon), all new threads will be posted to discord.
* Youtube Subscribe to a youtube channel and new video notifications will be posted to discord.
* Twitch - Get notifications when users go live.
* More coming (Always open to suggestions)

## How to use
To setup a subscription you need to use the command corresponding to the source of the content. E.G `~subscribetwitter` or `~subscribechan`. Vinny will walk you through the setup from there.  
  
## Limitations
Since Vinny utilizes RSS feeds to get data, we respect the source sites and do not spam them constantly to get updates. This means that as more people setup unique subscriptions the more checks we have to do.
We have put a lot of work into scaling subscriptions theoretically infinitly. This means that it should not be an issue, however, this also means that updates are not instant and at the worst case may be up to a minute behind.
