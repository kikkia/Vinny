# How to use Vinny
1. To use Vinny in your discord server you must first add it. You can do so by following the link above. Do not edit any of the permissions that Vinny requests, those are the minimum permissions it needs to do what it does. 
2. Once Vinny is in your server you can start to run commands. By default you can start a command with either `~` or by @'ing vinny then following it with the name of the command. Example: `~sinfo` or `@Vinny sinfo`. To see a [full list of commands, go here](docs/Commands.md)
